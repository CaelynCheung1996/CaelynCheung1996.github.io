I am currently a Data Scientist at Bayer Crop Science working on generative AI. I obtained my PhD in Bioengineering at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2024.

My PhD research mainly involves developing computational methods for analyzing wide-field calcium neuroimaging data. I have also worked on image analysis and processing for biomedical imaging applications such as microscopy, endoscopy, MRI, by use of machine learning and deep learning.

I have done internships at GE HealthCare (summer 2023) and Philips Healthcare (summer 2017). I worked on applications of diffusion models in medical ultrasound imaging.

I also served as an associate editor for [Medical Physics](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/24734209) and [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/), and reviewer for [IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=42), [Journal of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-biomedical-informatics), [Physics in Medicine & Biology](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0031-9155), [Journal of Biomedical Optics](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics?SSO=1), [Biomedical Signal Processing & Control](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control), [Journal of Imaging](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jimaging), [Applied Sciences](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci) and [Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine](https://jcsm.aasm.org/journal/jcsm).
