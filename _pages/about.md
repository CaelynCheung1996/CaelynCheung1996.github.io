I am a fourth-year PhD student of [Computational Imaging Science Lab](https://anastasio.bioengineering.illinois.edu/) led by Professor [Mark Anastasio](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/maa). 

My research involves computational methods in neuroimaging, especially for wide-field calcium imaging in mice. I have also worked on image analysis and processing for biomedical imaging applications such as microscopy, endoscopy, MRI, by use of machine learning and deep learning.

I received my B.E. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2018. I am currently a student member of the [SPIE](https://spie.org/?SSO=1) and the [RSNA](https://www.rsna.org/).

I also served as an associate editor for [Medical Physics](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/24734209), and reviewer for [Journal of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-biomedical-informatics), [Physics in Medicine & Biology](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0031-9155), [Journal of Biomedical Optics](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics?SSO=1) and [Biomedical Signal Processing](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control).
