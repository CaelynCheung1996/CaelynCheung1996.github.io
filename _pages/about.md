I am a final-year PhD student of [Computational Imaging Science Lab](https://anastasio.bioengineering.illinois.edu/) led by Professor [Mark Anastasio](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/maa). 

My research involves computational methods in neuroimaging, especially for wide-field calcium imaging in mice. I have also worked on image analysis and processing for biomedical imaging applications such as microscopy, endoscopy, MRI, by use of machine learning and deep learning.

I received my B.E. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2018. I am currently a student member of the [SPIE](https://spie.org/?SSO=1) and the [RSNA](https://www.rsna.org/).

I have done internships at GE HealthCare (summer 2023) and Philips Healthcare (summer 2017). I worked on applications of diffusion models in medical ultrasound imaging. I am actively looking for a full-time position as an Applied ML Scientist/Data Scientist/Computer Vision Engineer/Research Scientist in industry.

I also served as an associate editor for [Medical Physics](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/24734209) and [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/), and reviewer for [IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=42), [Journal of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-biomedical-informatics), [Physics in Medicine & Biology](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0031-9155), [Journal of Biomedical Optics](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics?SSO=1), [Biomedical Signal Processing & Control](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control), [Journal of Imaging](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jimaging), [Applied Sciences](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci) and [Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine](https://jcsm.aasm.org/journal/jcsm).
